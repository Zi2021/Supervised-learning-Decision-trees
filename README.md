Compulsory Task I
Follow these steps:
● Create a Decision Tree that can predict the survival of passengers on the
Titanic. Make sure not to impose any restrictions on the depth of the tree.
● Use the decision_tree_titanic.ipynb file provided, which has the
titanic.csv dataset loaded (sourced here) to complete the task.
● Select relevant variables from the data and split the data into a training,
development, and test set.
● Train a decision tree and make a plot of it.
● Compute your model’s accuracy on the development set.
● Try building your model with different values of the max_depth [2-10]. At
each step, create a plot of your tree and store the accuracies on both the
training and development data.
● Plot a line of your training accuracies and another of your development
accuracies in the same graph. Write down what shape the lines have and
what this shape means.
● Report the accuracy of your final model on the test data
